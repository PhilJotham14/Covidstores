      <p class="card-text">This new stage of training has been agreed in consultation with the Government, 
        medical experts, Premier League club doctors, players and managers. 
        The health and wellbeing of everyone involved is both ours and the Premier Leagueâ€™s priority. 
        Strict medical protocols are in place to ensure the training ground is the safest environment possible 
        and players and staff will continue to be tested for COVID-19 twice a week.

      <p class="card-text">This car demonstrates that it is possible to create a roadster version of a supercar with 
        unrivalled performance that is not only incredibly fast and dynamic, but also extremely comfortable and safe to drive. Without a doubt, the most impressive thing is the open-top driving: the passengers are directly exposed to the sound of the engine and turbochargers, 
        ensuring a unique and emotional driving experience. The Grand Sport Vitesse had its world premiere 
        at the Geneva Motor Show in 2012 and completes the range of Veyron models. </p>

      <p class="card-text">In April 2020, Sony officially took the wraps of DualSense: a radically
         redesigned PlayStation controller that will accompany the PS5. While DualSense has a familiar button layout 
         and brings back the touchpad from the DualShock 4, its two-toned black-and-white design looks 
         nothing like any PlayStation controller before it.

        As Sony confirmed before, DualSense will have haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, which will provide
        ealistic, tactile rumble to simulate the feel of, say, driving through mud or firing a bow and arrow. 
        The controller's Share button has been replaced by a new Create button, which Sony says will provide even 
        more ways to capture and share your favorite gameplay moments.

    <p class="card-text">WHO is working with research institutions to select traditional medicine products which can 
      be investigated for clinical efficacy and safety for COVID-19 treatment. In addition, 
      the Organization will continue to support countries as they explore the role of traditional health
       practitioners in prevention, control, 
      and early detection of the virus as well as case referral to health facilities.
